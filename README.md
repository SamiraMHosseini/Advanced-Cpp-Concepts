# MoveSemanticsAndRVO.cpp
This is an implementation of a simple CustomVector class in C++ demonstrating the usage of move semantics and Return Value Optimization (RVO).

Description
The class defines its own copy constructor, move constructor, and destructor, demonstrating how resources can be managed efficiently in C++. The program also demonstrates the concept of Return Value Optimization (RVO), where the compiler optimizes away unnecessary copy or move operations.

This serves as a practical example for understanding advanced C++ concepts such as move semantics, copy elision, and return value optimization.
